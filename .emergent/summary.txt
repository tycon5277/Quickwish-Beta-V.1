**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a Wisher application. The project has involved two major feature implementations:

1.  **Order Timeline Feature:** Integrate a new, external order lifecycle backend () to replace the existing mock data implementation for order tracking. This includes creating/listing orders, viewing a detailed timeline with status polling, and cancelling orders.

2.  **Promotions Feature:** Integrate promotion-related features from a separate backend (). This includes:
    *   A banner carousel on the Home screen.
    *   A real-data-driven Explore feed with like/follow functionality.
    *   Featured badges for shops in the Local Hub.

The most recent request is to add temporary mock data to the frontend to visualize the newly-implemented Promotions feature, as the backend currently has no data, making the UI appear empty.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application codebase has been updated to integrate both the Order Timeline and Promotions features. The code connects to the specified external APIs for data fetching on the relevant screens (, , , , ). However, since the backend APIs are returning empty arrays (no orders or promotions exist yet), these new features are not visually apparent in the app. The core app structure with tab navigation is in place.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The user requested the creation of mock data to visually demonstrate the new Promotions feature (Banners on Home, Featured Shops on Local Hub, real posts on Explore). The agent had just finished the code implementation for the feature, but it's not visible without data.
-   **Status**: NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N (Agent confirmed API endpoints were reachable but did no functional or visual testing of the new features).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing using mock data first. The agent should use the  to show the visual changes to the user for confirmation.
-   **User Testing Done**: N (User is blocked from testing until they can see the features, hence the request for mock data).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - **Issue 1: Add Mock Data for Promotions Feature (P0)**
     - **Description**: The user wants to see how the new promotions features look in the app before conducting real testing. This requires adding temporary mock data directly into the frontend code to populate the UI elements.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  In :
            -   Create a  array with 2-3 banner objects (with , , , , ).
            -   In the  for , comment out the  call and use  instead.
        2.  In :
            -   Create a  array containing a few  strings from the existing shop data in that file.
            -   In the  for , comment out the  call and use  instead.
        3.  In :
            -   Create  and  arrays with sample data matching the structure expected by the UI.
            -   In the  function, comment out the  calls and use  and .
        4.  After implementing the mock data, restart the frontend (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started).
        5.  Use the  to capture the , , and  screens to show the user the populated UI.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with this?** This will allow the user to visually verify the UI/UX of the Promotions feature before it's populated with real data, unblocking user feedback and testing.
     - **Status**: NOT STARTED
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (visually)
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P1) User Verification of Features**: Once mock data is shown, the user needs to verify both the Promotions and Order Timeline features.
    -   **(P1) Remove Mock Data**: After user verification, the temporary mock data must be removed to restore live API functionality.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **(P0) Build the Fulfillment Agent App:** A detailed prompt for this is saved at .
    -   **(P1) Backend for Explore Feed (Creation):** While the feed is now consumed from an API, a UI for vendors/creators to post content to the feed is still needed.
    -   **(P2) Real-time Chat with WebSockets:** Replace HTTP polling for order status.
    -   **(P2) Integrate a Real Payment Gateway.**
    -   **(P2) Push Notifications.**

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Feature: Order Timeline Integration (Code Complete)**
    -   Created  with functions to interact with the external order lifecycle backend.
    -   Updated  to use the new  API call on checkout.
    -   Rewrote  and  to fetch real order data and display a live-polling timeline.
-   **Feature: Promotions Integration (Code Complete)**
    -   Created  for date formatting.
    -   Updated  to include a  component that fetches data from the promotions API.
    -   Updated  to fetch featured shop IDs, sort them to the top, and display a FEATURED badge.
    -   Updated , replacing all mock data with API calls for the highlights and main feed, and adding / functionality.
-   **Bug Fix: Corrected Backend URL**
    -   Updated the hardcoded backend URL in  from  to the correct  as requested by the user.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **External API Integration:** Consuming multiple external REST APIs for core application features (Orders, Promotions).
-   **State Management:** Using  and  extensively to fetch, store, and manage data from APIs.
-   **Data-driven UI:** Components are designed to render based on data fetched from APIs, with graceful fallbacks for empty states.
-   **Data Transformation/Mapping:** Converting API response data into a format that the existing UI components can consume (e.g., in ).
-   **State Polling:** The order tracking screen () uses  to periodically refresh order status.

**key DB schema**
The application relies entirely on the API contracts provided by the external backends:
1. 
2. 

**changes in tech stack**
No new packages or technologies were added.

**All files of reference**
-   **New Files Created:**
    -   : Houses functions for the order lifecycle API endpoints.
    -   : A utility function to format dates for the UI.
-   **Key Files Modified:**
    -   : For the banner carousel.
    -   : For the data-driven feed.
    -   : For the featured shops badge.
    -   : For the list of real orders.
    -   : For the order detail timeline.
    -   : To connect the checkout process to the new order API.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Centralize API URLs:** The backend URLs for orders () and promotions () are hardcoded as constants in multiple files. They should be moved to a single configuration file or environment variables () to simplify future changes.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your immediate task is to add MOCK DATA.** The user wants to see the UI for the Promotions feature. You must temporarily modify , , and  to display hardcoded data instead of fetching from the API.
-   **Do not assume features are done.** The code for two major features (Orders and Promotions) has been written, but neither has been visually verified by the user because the live backends are empty. Your work on mock data is the unblocking step for this verification.
-   **Communicate Clearly:** After adding the mock data, take screenshots and show the user the populated UI. Ask for their approval before you proceed to remove the mock data and restore the live API calls.

5.  **User (from Message 5):** Provided the original, detailed prompt for the Order Timeline Feature. **(Status: COMPLETED - Code written)**

*(The remaining messages are agent/tool outputs or minor conversational filler)*

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** No part of the app is technically broken or crashing.
-   **Mocked:** The immediate next task is to *introduce* mock data into , , and  for visualization purposes. The original mock data was removed during development.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   Emergent Google Social Login
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: []
-   Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
None required. App uses Emergent-based Google Social Login. Authentication will be required to test the full user flows after the mock data visualization is approved.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has followed the user's explicit requests. However, it declared features complete based on code being written and APIs being reachable, without ensuring the features were visually verifiable by the user. This led to the current request for mock data. The next agent should prioritize user-verifiable deliverables.
