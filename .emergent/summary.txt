**original_problem_statement:**
The user has pivoted from UI enhancements to a new core feature implementation. The primary goal is to integrate a new, external order lifecycle backend into the QuickWish app, replacing the existing mock data implementation for order tracking.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Task:** Implement a full Order Timeline Feature.
- **Backend:** Use the provided external backend at . The existing internal FastAPI backend () should **not** be used for this feature.
- **API Endpoints to Integrate:**
  - **Create Order:** 
  - **Get My Orders:** 
  - **Get Order Status:**  (This should be polled every 10 seconds on the detail screen).
  - **Cancel Order:**  (Should only be possible for orders in a / state).
- **Frontend Implementation:**
  1.  **Order Tracking Screen ():**
      - Display a visual timeline of order statuses ( array from API).
      - Poll the  endpoint every 10 seconds to get live updates.
      - Display Genie (delivery agent) information when it becomes available.
      - Show a Cancel Order button only when the order status allows for cancellation.
  2.  **Orders List Screen ():**
      - List all of the user's past and current orders.
      - Display a status badge for each order with status-specific colors.
      - Tapping an order should navigate to the detail/tracking screen.
  3.  **Shop Page ():**
      - The checkout process must be updated to call the new  endpoint.
  4.  **API Utility:**
      - Create a dedicated API utility module (e.g., ) with functions for the new endpoints: , , , .
- **Status Colors:**
  - : Blue
  - : Green
  - : Orange
  - : Yellow
  - : Purple
  - : Blue
  - : Green
  - : Red

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application has a functional UI with Home, Explore, Local Hub, and Account screens. The My Orders feature exists but is built with static, mock data and is not connected to any real backend; it needs to be completely rebuilt. The app's UI was recently overhauled with a new color palette, a redesigned Highlights section on the Explore page (now large, auto-scrolling promotional cards), and the removal of swipe-based tab navigation.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent just started the Implement Order Timeline Feature task. It began by analyzing the existing, mock-data-based order screens ( and ) to understand their structure before refactoring them to use the new external API.
    - Status: **NOT STARTED** (No code has been written or modified for this new task yet).
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? **both** (Use  or a test script to validate the new external API endpoints first, then use the  after the UI is integrated).
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - **Issue 1: Implement Order Timeline Feature (P0)**
     - **Description**: The primary task is to integrate the new external order lifecycle backend as specified in the . This involves replacing the current mock-data My Orders feature entirely.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
        1. Create a new API utility file (e.g., ) and add the functions (, , etc.) provided by the user.
        2. Modify  to use  upon checkout.
        3. Rewrite  to fetch real order data using  and display it.
        4. Rewrite  to:
           - Fetch order details using .
           - Implement a polling mechanism ( with ) to call  every 10 seconds.
           - Display the  data visually.
           - Conditionally render the Cancel button.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with this?** This is a core feature for the app, allowing users to place and track real orders.
     - **Status**: NOT STARTED
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
None. The main task is listed as a pending issue.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **(P1) Backend for Explore Feed:** The redesigned Explore screen is using static, hardcoded data. A backend is needed for creators to post content dynamically.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - **(P0) Build the Fulfillment Agent App:** This is a major, separate application. A detailed prompt for building it has been created and saved at .
    - **(P2) Real-time Chat with WebSockets:** Replace HTTP polling with WebSockets.
    - **(P2) Integrate a Real Payment Gateway:** Implement Stripe or a similar service.
    - **(P2) Push Notifications:** Add push notifications for order updates and other events.

**Completed work in this session**
- **UI/UX Feature: Tab Navigation Update**
  - Disabled the custom swipe gesture for navigating between main tabs in .
- **UI/UX Feature: Explore Highlights Redesign**
  - Transformed the stories section into large, content-first promotional tiles that show an image and text directly.
  - Implemented auto-scrolling for these tiles with a 5-second interval and page indicator dots in .
- **UI/UX Feature: App-wide Re-styling**
  - Applied a new color palette (Lavender, Aqua, Yellow, Charcoal) across all main screens (, , , ).
  - Reverted the main tab bar to a white background with gray (ash) icons for better distinction, as requested by the user.
- **Support: Fulfillment App Prompt Generation**
  - Analyzed the existing backend and created a comprehensive prompt () for the user to start a new chat to build the separate Fulfillment Agent app.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **External API Integration:** The next task requires consuming a new, external REST API for all order-related functionality.
- **State Polling:** The order tracking screen will require using  within a  hook to periodically fetch status updates.
- **UI/Style Refactoring:** The agent performed a large-scale, manual update of color styles across multiple files.
- **Gesture Handling (Removal):** The agent removed  logic to disable swipe navigation.
- **Animated Scrolling:** Used  and  on a  combined with  to create an auto-scrolling carousel effect.

**key DB schema**
The application is pivoting to an external API for orders. The DB schema of the internal MongoDB is no longer the source of truth for the  collection. The API response contracts provided by the user are now the schema to build against.

**changes in tech stack**
No new packages were added.

**All files of reference**
- **To be modified for the new task:**
  -  (rewrite)
  -  (rewrite)
  -  (update checkout logic)
- **Recently Modified:**

  -  (redesigned highlights, added auto-scroll, changed colors)

- **New Supporting Doc:**

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Centralize Colors:** The new color scheme has been applied by manually changing hex codes in dozens of places. A centralized color theme file (e.g., ) should be created to store these values, making future theme changes trivial.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **PIVOT TO EXTERNAL API:** Your primary task is to implement the order timeline feature using a **new, external backend**. Do **NOT** use the existing  for any order-related logic. The base URL is .
- **REWRITE, DON'T PATCH:** The existing files in  are based on mock data. You must rewrite their data-fetching and state management logic completely to work with the new polling-based API.
- **CHECKOUT FLOW:** Remember to update the final step of the checkout process in  to call the new  endpoint.
